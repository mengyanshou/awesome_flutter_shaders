// --- Migrate Log ---
// 迁移日期: 2025-12-19
// - 已从 Shadertoy 仓库迁移：添加公共头文件与缺失的 uniform(iChannel0, iChannel2) 以保证移植兼容性。
// - 将 mainImage 内局部 vec4 c 显式初始化为 vec4(0.0) 以避免在 SkSL/部分 GLSL 实现中的未定义读取。
// - 本次修改仅为兼容性修复，不更改 shader 算法逻辑。
// --- Migrate Log (EN) ---
// Migration date: 2025-12-19
// - Migrated from Shadertoy: added common header and missing uniforms (iChannel0, iChannel2) for portability.
// - Initialized local vec4 c = vec4(0.0) in mainImage to avoid undefined reads in some GLSL/SkSL targets.
// - These edits are non-functional adjustments; algorithmic logic unchanged.
