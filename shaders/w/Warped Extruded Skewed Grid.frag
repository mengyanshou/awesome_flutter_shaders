    Warped Extruded Skewed Grid
    ---------------------------

    This is a warped extruded skewed grid, rendered in an early 2000s demoscene 
    style. In particular, the grid cell centers have been skewed into position, 
    then two different sized nonskewed squares have been constructed around them
    to form a pinwheel arrangement.

	I've been putting up a bunch of tech-like examples lately, so to break the
	monotony for myself, I decided to code something artsy and more reminiscent 
    of a cliche 2000s demo scene. A lot of 2000s demos were rendered in a grungey 
    dystopian graphic art style, so I kind of went with that. On the technical 
    side, it's a demonstration of grid construction consisting of two different 
    kinds of tiles rendered in a staggered fashion. There's nothing in here 
    that's particularly difficult to implement.

	One of the many things I've always admired about demo coders in general is 
    their ability to identify the most visually enticing effects that can be
    produced with the least amount of effort on whatever machine they're running 
    on.

	I've attempted to emulate that philosophy by employing a few simple 
    techniques that demoscoders take for granted. These include things like
    rendering minor details outside the main loop and concentrating on the cheap 
    aspects that have the largest visual impact, like color palettes and camera 
    motion.

    Decent color palettes and textures usually account for a large part of the 
    the final image, and they cost virtually nothing. Camera movements can add 
    interest to a scene, and in the grand scheme of things are very cheap to 
    implement. Warping space can be a little fiddly, especially when positioning 
    lights and so forth, but it's also cheap and interesting, so I've made use
    of that too.

    The only thing here that I'd consider new is the grid arrangement. I like it 
    because it's a completely ordered grid that looks randomized in height map 
    form, which makes it visually interesting and relatively cheap to produce. 
    Having said that, there are still 8 taps and some skewing involved, so it's 
    probably not the kind of scene that a slow system would be happy with.

    The frame rate in window form was surprisingly better than I'd expected. 
    Having said that, I'm on a pretty quick machine, and it doesn't like running 
    in fullscreen, so it's all relative. There are at least two things that could
    improve performance. One is face and height buffer storage and the other is
    using a pinwheel (or pythagorean) arrangement for five (or possibly three) 
    taps, but that would be at the expense of readability, so I'm going to leave 
    it alone.

    By the way, for anyone interested in just the grid code, I'll put up a much
	simpler example later.
